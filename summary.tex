\chapter{Summary}
\pagestyle{headings}

The summary consists of one or two pages, and covers all chapters of the report except the appendices. In other words: it should at least summarize the back\-ground/moti\-vation of the work, the goal or research question, the approach, the results, and the main conclusions and recommendations. Divide the summary in paragraphs that roughly correspond to the chapters in the main body of your report. You do not need to explicitly mention the different chapters though.

Introduce acronyms in your summary \emph{only} if you use them later in the summary. Do not use the \texttt{$\backslash$ac} command in the summary; also see Section~\ref{sec:acronyms}.

It is not very common to cite references in the summary. It is possible though, particularly if the presented work really builds up on one or more particular papers/reports.
