\chapter{Title of first appendix}
\label{app:appendix_A}

Anything that does not directly contribute to the understanding for the reader, but is still relevant in order to support particular claims made in the report (for instance a purely mathematical derivation), should be put in the appendix. (That is, only if it cannot be found elsewhere. Otherwise a simple citation suffices.)

For the rest the appendices are like the other chapters, i.e. they can have sections, figures, tables, and citations (even though the appendix comes after the list of references).
